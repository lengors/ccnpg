## How Can I Contribute?

You can contribute to the **ccnpg** in a few ways. The easiest method is to [start a discussion](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/discussions) or [open an issue](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/issues) on the [repository](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg). If youâ€™re feeling ambitious, feel free to jump right into coding and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/pulls).

The preferred method of contribution is to start a discussion so that both the maintainers and the community are made aware of your suggestion and/or improvement and so that both can assess if it makes sense to promote the discussion into an issue worth tracking. It should be noted that even if the discussion is promoted to an issue, it may never end up being worked on, as the need for the proposed changes may vary over time.

The details for the various ways of contributing are as described below:

### Reporting Bugs

If you discover a bug or unexpected behavior, please [post a question on our community](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/discussions/new?category=q-a), [start a general discussion](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/discussions/new?category=general) or [report the bug as an isuse](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) and follow the instructions there.
Please be as descriptive as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant details.

### Suggesting Features or Enhancements

We welcome your ideas for new features or improvements to existing ones. To suggest a feature, [share your idea with the community](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/discussions/new?category=ideas) or [request a feature as an issue](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) and follow the instructions there. Please be as descriptive as possible. You may even include implementation proposals!

### Other suggestions

If you instead want to suggest improvements to documentation, deployment pipelines and build processes, or report other issues or suggestions, please [start a general discussion](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/discussions/new?category=general) or [create a task for us](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg/issues/new?template=create_task.yml) and follow the instructions there. Please be as descriptive as possible and select the appropriate labels.

### Pull Requests

We also encourage direct contributions that improve the project through pull requests. To submit your changes, follow these steps:

1. Fork the project.
2. Create a branch for your feature, bug fix or other changes.
3. Implement your changes and ensure they adhere to our code style and conventions.
4. Write tests to validate your changes (if applicable).
5. Submit a pull request (PR) to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lengors/ccnpg).

Your PR will be reviewed by project maintainers. If necessary, we may request further changes before merging.
